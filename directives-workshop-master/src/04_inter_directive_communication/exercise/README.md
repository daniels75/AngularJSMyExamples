## Exercise

Build a simple accordion directive as seen on the Bootstrap's [demo page](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse).
Hint: you can adapt the collapse directive

## Bootstrap CSS

Bootstrap 3 accordion's are nothing more than a group of collapse directives
wrapped into a `<div>` with the `panel-group` class. Check the solution for the collapse directive
to see the HTML structure needed for an individual collapsible panel.
